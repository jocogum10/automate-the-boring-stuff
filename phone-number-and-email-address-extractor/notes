Whenever you’re tackling a new project, it can be tempting to dive right
into writing code. But more often than not, it’s best to take a step back and
consider the bigger picture. I recommend first drawing up a high-level plan
for what your program needs to do. Don’t think about the actual code yet—
you can worry about that later. Right now, stick to broad strokes.

what your program needs to do:
1. get the text off the clipboard
2. find all phone numbers and email address in the text
3. paste them into the clipboard

what your code needs to do:
1. use the pyperclip module to copy and paste strings
2. create two regexes, one for matching phone numbers and the other
for matching email addresses.
3. find all matches, not just the first match, of both regexes.
4. neatly format the matched strings into a single string to paste.
5. display some kind of message if no matches were found in the text

This list is like a road map for the project. As you write the code, you
can focus on each of these steps separately. Each step is fairly manageable
and expressed in terms of things you already know how to do in Python.
